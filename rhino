      A rhinoceros ( from Greek rhinokerōs 'nose-horned', from rhis 'nose', and
      keras 'horn'), commonly abbreviated to rhino, is a member of any of the
      five extant species of odd-toed ungulates in the family. In total, there
      are about <strong>30,000 rhinos</strong> in the world.The rhinoceros is a
      herbivore. Its favourite food is plants, branches and bushes (if it is a
      browser species), or grass (if it is a grazer species). Rhinoceroses have
      a large horn on the nose. Their horns are not like those of other horned
      mammals: the rhinoceros' horn is made of keratin packed together very
      tightly. The rhinoceroses can weigh up to 2,000 kilograms (4,400 lb) and
      be up to 375 centimetres (12.30 ft) tall.

    <h2>Where are rhinos found?</h2>
    <p>
      Rhinos are found in both Asia and Africa. Historically they were also
      found in Europe but were wiped out by climate change and most notably the
      influence of man
    </p>
    <h2 id="subspecies">What subspecies of rhinos exist?</h2>
    <p>
      There are two subspecies of white rhinoceros: the southern white
      rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) and the northern white
      rhinoceros(Ceratotherium simum cottoni). As of 2013, the southern
      subspecies has a wild population of 20,405—making them the most abundant
      rhino subspecies in the world. However, the northern subspecies is
      critically endangered, with all that is known to remain being two captive
      females. There is no conclusive explanation of the name "white rhinoceros"
    </p>
    <h2>Are rhinos endangered?</h2>
    <p>
      Rhino are a critically endangered species. There are less than 30,000
      rhino living in the wild today. At the start of the 20th century, there
      were over 500,000. Human activity has caused this dramatic decline in
      rhino numbers. Initially numbers dropped due to hunting, but today the
      main threats to rhino are poaching and habitat loss.Three species of
      rhino—black, Javan, and Sumatran—are critically endangered. Today, a small
      population of Javan rhinos is found in only one national park on the
      northern tip of the Indonesian island of Java. A mainland subspecies of
      the Javan rhino was declared extinct in Vietnam in 2011.The majority
      (98.8%) of the southern white rhinos occur in just four countries: South
      Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. Southern white rhinos were thought
      to be extinct in the late 19th century, but in 1895 a small population of
      less than 100 individuals was discovered in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa.
      After more than a century of protection and management, they are now
      classified as Near Threatened and 19,600 – 21,000 animals exist in
      protected areas and private game reserves. They are the only of the five
      rhino species that are not endangered.

    <h2 id="ok">My experience with rhinos</h2>
    <p>
      When I went to the Nigerian safari, rhinos were one of the first animals I
      saw. They curiously walked towards our car and stared intently whilst
      remaining precariously still. This allowed us to take some amazing photos
      like the ones you can see below. The tour guide told us that rhinos were
      actually blind , which was quite an interesting fact which I can assure
      you very little people know. Another thing he told us is that rhinos will
      attack anything they percieve as a threat which can include things like
      termite mounds and twigs! We then got to feed the rhinos but had to be
      careful to not agitate the 2 ton beast. After feeding it , we got to watch
      the guide feed them himself and lets just say he did a way better job than
      us.He attracted a multitude of rhinos who came sprinting at the mere
      prescence of food and began devouring as soon as they layed their mouth on
      the treats. The rhinos were a great part of the safari experience and
      suprisingly did not display aggressive behaviour, juxtaposing how they are
      presented in the media . Legendary hunter Babatunde is said to have killed
      over 3000 rhinos and was a major part of the rhinos "Critically
      endangered" status. In order to remove that status, we must ensure these
      animals thrive in poacher-free environments. This is why I have attached a
      link for you to donate to save the rhinos, to help provide these
      magnificent creates with a safer , more sustainable future.
